# Twitter-Data-Analysis

This project is about understanding the topics in the input data of the current political situations of the US, China, and Taiwan. These topics will help us to analyze the context of the data. In order to complete this task we will use Topic modeling and Sentiment analysis. We will follow the data science workflow to complete this task. 



    





## Workflow

- ### Data Understanding
 
	In this project two JSON datasets are given. The dataset is collected from Twitter tweets. The datasets are global_twitter_data.json, and african_twitter_data.json. It has so many columns, and some of them are 'created_at', 'source', 'original_text', 'polarity', 'subjectivity', 'lang', 'favorite_count', 'retweet_count', 'original_author', 'followers_count' ,'friends_count','possibly_sensitive', 'hashtags', 'user_mentions' and 'place'. 

- ### Data Preparation

	We have to clean and preprocess the raw data in order to make it ready for our model. We will manage missing data, duplicate data, different language data, and implement other preprocessing techniques. We will split our data into training, validation, and tests.

- ### Modeling

	We will train our model based on the processed data. In this step we will try various types of models to get a good accuracy in the prediction. We will use train and validation data.

- ### Evaluation

	We will measure the accuracy of our model using our test data.

- ### Deployment

	When we are sure about the accuracy of our model we will deploy it, and we can make predictions using that.
